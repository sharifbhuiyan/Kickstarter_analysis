# Analysis the project Outcomes of Campaign



  ## 1. Overview of Project: 
The purpose of the project to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Also analysis is performed to project the fundraise in a short amount of time.
 The project contains two technical analyses including tables and graphically visualization. 
Table and chart : 1) Outcomes Based on Launch Date  
2) Outcomes Based on Goals

2. Analysis and Challenges: 
Basically Analysis has been accomplished based on two technical analysis. Theater outcomes based on launch date and outcomes based on Goals.
i) Theater outcomes based on launch date:
A “Pivot table” has been created based on  "successful," "failed," and "canceled" outcomes. 
A “Line with markers” chart has been created to to visualize campaign outcomes based on launch date. It visualizes the relationship between outcomes and launch month.
ii)  Outcomes based on Goals :
Excel function has been used to collect the outcome and goal data for the “plays” subcategory and calculated the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled projects for each row.
A line chart has been created to visualize the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled plays based on the funding goal amount. 

Though this data is for long period from year 2010 to 2017. 

If you had no challenges, describe any possible challenges or difficulties that could be encountered.

3. Final Outcomes from analysis:
 Theater Outcomes by Launch Date
1)	The most successful month for Kickstarter campaigns was May.
2)	Jan, Mar, Sep, Nov and Dec all had almost the same number of failed campaigns launched. Though December successful and failed outcomes showing almost same point.

Outcomes based on Goals
The 100% failed range was ‘45000 to 49999’, where number of total project was single. Though the highest number of successful in target range 1000 to 4999, which was 73%. But the highest successful rate 76% was in target range “Less than 1000”.

o	What are some limitations of this dataset?


o	some other possible tables and/or graphs that could be created
Clustered column can be created for showing Theater outcomes in “Y” axis and months in “X” axis. 

Dataset has outliers. It can be demonstrated by creating a Box and Whisker Plot.
