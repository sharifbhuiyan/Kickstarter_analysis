  - [Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date and Outcomes Based on Goals](https://github.com/sharifbhuiyan/Kickstarter_analysis/blob/main/Kickstarter_Challenge.zip)

### i) Theater outcomes based on launch date:

o	Limitations of this dataset.


- - some other possible tables and/or graphs that could be created
      Clustered column can be created for showing Theater outcomes in “Y” axis and months in “X” axis. 

      Dataset has outliers. It can be demonstrated by creating a Box and Whisker Plot.
